About
======
I am a PhD student on the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io), jointly hosted by Imperial College London and the University of Oxford. My current research interests are broadly related to Reinforcement Learning, with a specific focus on the applications of foundation models for decision making tasks. As part of my PhD, I have also taken classes on topics such as Variational inference and Diffusion models (to be expanded later in the year!)

Outside of research/academia, I enjoy playing squash and exploring new parts of London, particularly when there's food involved.

If anything on my site is of interest, please feel free to reach out! I am always open to enquiries related to interesting problems (doesn't have to be RL specific - please see my blog for some other examples), or if you want to discuss my research further. The best way to contact me is via email at jaw124[at]ic.ac.uk
